### First Steps

The ultimate first step is to decide about mulitlanguage on the page. Check out [the introduction on languages](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/languages/introduction) in the Kirby documentation. Add the desired setting to the configuration and add the languages to `site/languages`. From this point on you will have to append language suffixes to the articles you write and the content you will create.
